# Automated FastDownload Script For cs1.6 servers in Linux for people who use OpenGamePanel with the build-in FastDownload module (Ubuntu/Debian)

This Script Was Created By ! A M 1 N E

Works in All Debian/Ubuntu Servers
Changes : No change needed in script, all you have to do is

Make sure to have configured fastDL alias like this : FastDL link should be `http://Server_IP:8080/YourServerPort`

Make sure that's the FastDownload Port is 8080 if it is not, just change it from the code, The FastDL folder in the module should be your Server Port

It's a script which people buy it but don't do all the required job

so i decided to make it and share it for free.
